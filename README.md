# Report on U.S. Healthcare System Efficiency and the Impact of Internet Usage on Health Outcomes

Background:
GetBetterHealth.com (GBH) is a startup aiming to reduce healthcare costs and improve efficiency in the U.S. healthcare system. Their focus lies in examining the relative efficiency of the U.S. healthcare system and understanding how internet usage affects health outcomes. The analysis used two primary data sources: OECD.Stat for comparing international healthcare outcomes and the HINTS dataset for analyzing internet usage's impact on health outcomes.

Objective:

Assess the efficiency of the U.S. healthcare system compared to other OECD countries.
Understand the relationship between internet usage and health outcomes while controlling for demographics.
1. U.S. Healthcare System vs. Other OECD Countries
Key Metrics Assessed:

Life Expectancy:
Life expectancy of females in the U.S. is 80.91 years, 9.46% lower than the expected value of 88.57 based on GDP.
Life expectancy of males in the U.S. is 75.88 years, 10.70% lower than the expected value of 84 based on GDP.
Infant Mortality Rate:
The expected infant mortality rate in the U.S. should ideally be zero, but the actual rate is 5.85 per 1,000 live births, 5.85% higher than expected.
Health Care Effectiveness Score:

A KPI was calculated by normalizing healthcare outcomes against GDP.
Scores show that the U.S. has the lowest score among OECD countries:
Females: 93
Males: 93
Infant Mortality Rate: 18
Conclusion:
The U.S. healthcare system is comparatively inefficient, with lower life expectancy and higher infant mortality rates despite a higher percentage of GDP spent on healthcare.

2. Impact of Internet Usage on Health Outcomes
Survey Data Analysis:

The analysis was conducted using the HINTS dataset with over 6,000 survey entries.
Key variables included internet connection, confidence in using the internet for health, and telehealth satisfaction.
Regression Analysis:
Two regression models were used to assess the relationship between internet usage and health outcomes.

Multiple Regression Model:
Focused on a single health outcome (Telehealth_GoodCare), measuring satisfaction with telehealth services.
Higher satisfaction with internet connection slightly decreases satisfaction with telehealth care (Coefficient: -0.0355).
Multiple Outcomes Regression Model:
Examined the relationship between internet usage and various health outcomes:
Cancer Concern Quality:
Higher confidence in using the internet correlates with reduced concerns (Coefficient: -0.0999).
Frequent internet health information search correlates with increased concern (Coefficient: 0.5975).
Life Has Meaning:
Extensive internet use for health purposes is negatively associated with life meaning (Coefficient: -0.0925).
Deep Fulfillment:
Internet health information search shows a positive association with fulfillment (Coefficient: 0.0636).
Age is a significant factor (Coefficient: 0.1920).
Clear Sense of Direction:
Better internet connection negatively impacts sense of direction (Coefficient: -0.0301).
Feelings of Hopelessness:
Higher internet confidence correlates with increased feelings of hopelessness (Coefficient: 0.0605).
Adequate Sleep:
Confidence in using the internet positively correlates with adequate sleep (Coefficient: 0.0605).

Conclusion:

Positive Impacts:
Improved internet connection and confidence are positively associated with deep fulfillment and sleep.
Negative Impacts:
Extensive internet use for health information can lead to increased concerns about cancer quality and feelings of hopelessness.
Older adults report deeper fulfillment and a clearer sense of direction despite extensive internet usage.

Recommendations

Improve Healthcare Efficiency:
Focus on reducing infant mortality rates and increasing life expectancy to align with GDP spending.

Promote Positive Internet Usage:
Encourage balanced internet usage to avoid anxiety-inducing health information.
Enhance telehealth services to improve satisfaction among users.

Further Research:
Explore strategies to reduce healthcare costs while improving health outcomes.
Understand demographic nuances in internet usage for personalized interventions.
